## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Poetry for dependency management

### Dependencies

All dependencies are listed in `pyproject.toml`. Key libraries include:
- `pandas`: Data manipulation
- `xgboost`: Model training
- `scikit-learn`: Data splitting and evaluation
- `joblib`: Saving and loading models

---

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iair/deployment_demo_model_training.git
   cd deployment_demo_model_training
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use Poetry to install all required dependencies.
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Prepare the Environment**:
   - Ensure the `data/` folder contains your dataset.
   - The `models/` folder will store trained models.

---

## Usage

Run the training pipeline using the following command:
```bash
poetry run python src/main.py
```

### Output
- The trained model will be saved in the `models/` folder with the current date appended to its name.

---

## Details

### Data

- **Input Data**:
  - Place the dataset in the `data/` folder.
  - The dataset should include a target column for supervised learning.

- **Preprocessing**:
  - Missing values are handled and numerical features are scaled.
  - Specify columns for imputation in `data_processor.py`.

### Training

- **Model**:
  - The pipeline uses `XGBoost` for training.
  - Default parameters are defined in `trainer.py` but can be modified as needed.

- **Evaluation**:
  - Model performance is evaluated on a test set.
  - Metrics like accuracy are printed to the console.

- **Saving**:
  - Trained models are saved with a timestamp for version control.
